1. By having all our handler functions be unique, we gain the ability to have each
exception/interrupt to be treated in a unique way, and it allows us to look at the system
stack to see which functions are being called at each fault.

2. A PGFault interrupt causes a more substantial interrupt than the general protection fault. 
as such, we shouldn't be using it unless absolutely necessary.

3. If an exception is thrown without a specific IDT entry to correspond to it, it defaults to a general protection fault. This is to ensure that SOMETHING happens, but maybe not shutting down the whole system.

4. These mechanisms are designed to have a sort of "hierarchy of problems" that pause the system
as necessary. There are many different kinds of faults that need to be handled by the kernel as to not
perform an operation that breaks the entire system, as such it's important to set up exceptions and protocols
for each case in which something can go wrong.
